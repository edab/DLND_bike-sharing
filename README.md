# NN for bike sharing prediction

This project aim to develop a *Neural Network* to predict bike sharing ride, based on the **Bike Sharing Dataset** by Hadi Fanaee-T of the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto.

This is my first project for the *Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree*, an is based on Torch and jupyter notebook.

The aim of the project is to design the Forward and Backward pass of the Neural Network, and tune the Hiperparameters to achieve a training loss below 0.09 and a validation loss below 0.18.
